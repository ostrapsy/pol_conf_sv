Starting off as a graduate historian, I switched to an entirely different discipline: occupational assessor trying to help young people with disabilities to get a job. I’ve just retired and started spending more time on my hobbies, such as singing, reading, and playing volleyball. A group I am a member of is The Texas Vols!",

I’ve been a computer programmer in the states for about 30 years, but don’t worry: I don’t have the dusty haircut, oversized buttoned shirt and nerdie big frame glasses. I am a member of a group called World War Ethusiasts- we recreate and discuss things a war related. Cheers, John",

Climbing never bores me, because each time is different – the routes, the weather, my strength and endurance. It’s great! So I guess most relevantly I am a proud member of Climbing Enthusiasts.",

Our sons attended international schools wherever we went and since moving to China, I found work at those schools as well. Besides roaming around the world, I like playing games. Board games, cards, black jack or poker, mah jong, or silly games on Facebook, jig saws, basically anything. For a group I am a part of, I think the best one is my tuesday night Poker group",
